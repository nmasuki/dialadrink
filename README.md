When you deploy your KeystoneJS app to production, be sure to set your `ENV` environment variable to `production`.

You can do this by setting `NODE_ENV=production` in your `.env` file, which gets handled by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

Setting your environment enables certain features (including template caching, simpler error reporting, and HTML minification) that are important in production but annoying in development.
